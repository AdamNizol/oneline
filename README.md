# One Line
### [Live Demo](https://adamnizol.github.io/oneline/)

One Line is a simple project I made which was inspired by the artist TFoust10 in which images are drawn and filled using a single line. In an attempt to get the same effect I used a recursive maze generation algorithm to fill the space with a maze that had no loops. I then traced around it to get a single line fill.

#### Known issues: 
Although the maze generation is easily adaptable to any shape, the project currently only fills a square but is intended to take a black and white images as input in the future.
