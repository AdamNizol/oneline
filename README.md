# One Line
### [Live Demo](https://adamnizol.github.io/oneline/)

One Line is a simple project I made which was inspired by the artist TFoust10 in which images are drawn and filled using a single line. In an attempt to get the same effect I used a recursive maze generation algorithm to fill the space with a maze that had no loops. I then traced around it to get a single line fill.

#### Known issues: 
-the detail slider adjusts the output line-width before refresh is clicked

-output detail is only updated when an image is uploaded, not when refreshed

-output svg is scaled down
